Fresh TV is a project born from a single developer, with the goal of create a new app, simple for every one and with a very "FRESH" design!
The app is built following the guidelines of the Google Material DesignÂ®.

With Fresh TV you can watch your favorite TV channels simply importing your M3U Playlists. ( PLAYLIST NOT INCLUDED! )

You can also surf the Tv Guide importing your EPGs!

AS ALREADY SAID, NO M3U PLAYLISTS ARE INCLUDED.

The App is currently in Alpha stage and many features will be implemented
Here's the roadmap:
- Italian translation
- Restore last position in Channel's list
- Fix EPG
- Don't interrupt playing during screen's rotation
- Store Movies' progress
- Dark Theme
- Improvements on channel's clean up on Playlist deletion in database
- Floating Player
- Search feature
- Edit Groups and Channels
- Info for Movies
- Improve visibility of white icons
- Chromecast support
